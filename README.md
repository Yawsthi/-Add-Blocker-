Enjoy a cleaner, faster YouTube by automatically blocking all video ads, sponsored posts, and promotional banners. This extension declutters your feed, ensuring a seamless and uninterrupted viewing experience.
## For Windows Users üìÅ
Windows has a built-in tool that makes unzipping easy.

Locate the File: Find the .zip file you saved (it's likely in your "Downloads" folder).

Right-Click: Right-click on the .zip file. A menu will pop up.

Extract All: Select the "Extract All..." option from the menu.

Choose a Destination: A new window will appear, asking where you want to save the extracted files. The default location (the same folder the .zip file is in) is usually the best choice.

Extract: Click the "Extract" button.

A new folder, without the zipper icon, will appear. Your files are now ready to use inside this new folder.

## For macOS Users Ô£ø
On a Mac, the process is even simpler.

Locate the File: Find the .zip file (likely in your "Downloads" folder).

Double-Click: Simply double-click the .zip file.

That's it! The Mac's built-in Archive Utility will automatically create a new, unzipped folder in the same location. Your files are inside that new folder.

## What Happens Next? ‚ú®
After extracting, you will have two items: the original .zip file and a new regular folder with the same name. You should use the files from the new folder. You can safely delete the original .zip file if you no longer need it.

Step 3: Load the Extension
Click the "Load unpacked" button that appeared on the top-left.

A file window will open. Navigate to and select the main extension folder (e.g., youtube-ad-suppressor).

Click the "Select Folder" button.

Your extension will now appear as a card on the Extensions page. To make it visible in your toolbar, click the puzzle piece icon (üß©) and then click the pin icon (üìå) next to your extension's name.
